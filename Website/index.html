        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p> In a world of enchanting language of melodies, Sonicmatic aims to be a music management platform that 
            simplifies the music listening experience. Sonicmatic is a space where users can listen to their own or on 
            demand music while curating their library of songs and sharing their musical experiences with other listeners. </p>

        <p> This platform will allow its diverse users to have the complete music listening experience, as they listen to the songs they have and discover new music from our database. 
            They will be able to organize these songs in custom lists or sort them by genre or artists. Moreover, the users will also get to listen to the songs they love with the people 
            close to them. Our chat feature allows users to share the songs they are listening to with their friends individually or as a group. Listeners can also review and show their 
            love for their favorite artists and songs and watch them rise on the platform’s leaderboards.</p>

        <p> Sonicmatic not only allows listeners to enjoy but also offers artists to share their music with all users by uploading it to our database, as singles or albums. Artists will be
            able to view stats such as how many people are listening to them, which songs are the most popular, how many times their music has been shared and what their listeners think of
            them.</p>

        <p> This platform is designed for everyone who listens to and shares music. This includes people who enjoy a few songs to hardcore audiophiles with large libraries of music. For new 
            listeners, this project provides an opportunity for them to discover new music and start a collection, whereas established music lovers have the tools to manage their collection 
            and continue to seamlessly grow it. This project is also for artists to put their music into circulation and keep track of its success. Moreover, this platform is for listeners 
            who like to share and discuss music, which they can do using the chat feature.  </p>

        <p> This project’s value lies with the centralization of a person’s music collection and the platform’s powerful music sharing abilities. Firstly, a user can add their personal music
            collection into this system and manage their library of music. They can then add more music into their collection seamlessly through the platform’s provided library of music.
            This allows for new listeners to easily start then grow their collection of music, or if they’re already an established audiophile, continue to discover new music easily and 
            instantly have it in their collection. Secondly, the chat feature provides great value in sharing music with friends and loved ones. This not only helps people to become exposed
            to more music they might enjoy, but also come together and share valuable bonding moments with one another.</p>

        <p> The success of this platform is based off two criteria. The first will be the total number of songs played (both owned by the user and published on our platform by artists) 
            exceeding 2,500 monthly. The second will be the total time all users spend listening to music on our platform, exceeding 10,000 monthly.</p>
