# Iteration 1 Retrospective

## Retrospective Scope
- The development, design, and source control involved in iteration one. 

## What went well? 

- Communication. 
- Teamwork. 
- Did our assigned dev tasks. 
- Iteration one works and is completed. 

## What needs improvement/didn’t go well? 

- An inactive group member left a user story undeveloped and did not complete the assigned dev task. 
- Git merge issues leaving us scrambling to get the repo working even after the deadline had passed. 
- Needed more detailed dev tasks, go further beyond a general user story with technical terms. 
- A lot of last-minute coding, changes, and commits. 

## Next steps 

- Take more time for the dev tasks and flesh them out better. 
- Earlier starts on coding and more time spent on the project. 
- More commits and pushes. 
- Frequent merges of working code into the dev branch.

### Dharm 

- I created the UI and the back end of creating a playlist and allowing the users to navigate through the app using the bottom navigation. I did have some

### Elan

- What did you do well? The music player. This is one of the core features of our project. It was a bigger undertaking than I thought it would be, and there seemed to be a million wrong ways to do it with only one right one. I’m happy that the implementation I created satisfies all the current and future needs of playing audio files for our system.

### Manuel: 

- I wrote the required and supporting documentation for the iteration and added unit tests for the database interface. 
- I didn’t write much code for this iteration. My best code is the Database Interface
